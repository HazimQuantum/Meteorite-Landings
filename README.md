Meteorite Fall Data Analysis

Data Source

Approximately 38,000 meteorite records were collected by the Meteoritical Society and published on NASA's Open Data Portal.
The dataset includes meteorites dated from the year 860 to 2013.

Data analysis was performed using Python.

Visualizations and dashboards were created using Excel and Power BI.

Time-based Discovery Analysis

From 860 to 1972: 2,337 meteorites were discovered.

From 1972 to 2013: 35,808 meteorites were discovered.


> The sharp increase in discoveries after 1972 can be attributed to the rise in scientific research activities.

Fell vs Found Statistics

Meteorites observed falling (Fell): 1,065

Meteorites found post-impact (Found): 37,050


> Most meteorites are only found after falling, often because many have small masses or fell long before systematic searches began.




---

Weathering (Erosion) Statistics

Well-preserved meteorites: 38,094

Meteorites affected by erosion: 21


> This data reflects the degree of terrestrial weathering meteorites have undergone.
